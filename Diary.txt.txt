Here's my diary about SPARTA 21

Day 0 :
Day 0 of SPARTA HMIF was held on Monday, 4th July 2022. I actually don't know if it was gonaa be the day 0 SPARTA HMIF. Before that, we gotta solve a puzzle that was given to us. 
After solving that puzzle, we got a zoom meeting ID and password. That ID and password was going to be used on the Day 0 SPARTA HMIF meeting. 
Unfortunately, there was a technical failure in Palembang's electric energy supplier. It caused a blackout in Palembang on that night. Because of that, I didn't attend that meeting.

Day 1 :
The first day of SPARTA HMIF was held on Thursday, 7th July 2022. Before that, I also remember that we gotta post a twibbon on our instagram and sign a contract.
In that day, there was a seminar about "Urgensi Kemahasiswaan". AFter that, there was a evaluation forum. In that day, we are 4 task that we must finish.
1. Make an essay about webinar "Urgensi Kemahasiswaan"
2. Interview with the other SPARTANS. Before Day 2, we had to have interviewed 5 SPARTANS.
3. Make an online "yearbook"
4. Make a same-pose photo and then change our line, google account, and zoom profile picture. 
5. Make a virtual background for Zoom
6. Take part in Wisuda Juli HMIF ITB 2022

Day 2 :
This day was definitely more exciting than day 1. It's because we can know many things about HMIF ITB. 
We can know the history, meaning of the logo, AD-ART, Mars, Hymne, and other activities in HMIF.
